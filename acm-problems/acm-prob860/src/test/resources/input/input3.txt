Midnight, not a sound from the pavement
Has th,e moo.n lost her memory?
****END_OF_TEXT****
She is smiling alone
In the lamp:light, the withe;red leaves collect at my feet
And the wind beg!ins to moan
****END_OF_TEXT****
Memory, all alone in the moonlight
I can dream of the old days
Life was beau?tiful then
****END_OF_TEXT****
I reme"mber the time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every street lamp seems to beat
****END_OF_TEXT****
A fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
Soon it will be morning
Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life and
I mustn't give in
When the da?wn comes
****END_OF_TEXT****
Tonight will be a memory too
And a ne!w day will begin
Burnt out en
ds of smoky days
The stale court smell of morning
A street lamp dies

       

Ano ther night is over



Another day is daw
ning
Touch me,
****END_OF_TEXT****
It is so easy to leave me
All alone with the mem(ory
Of my days in the sun
If you'll touch me,
You'll under)stand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun
